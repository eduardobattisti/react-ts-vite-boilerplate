# Boilerplate for React projects using Typescript, Vite, Vitest and Tailwind

This project is a simple boilerplate to use on React projects using Vite.
It has already default configuration for test, autoimports and lint. The main
idea is to create a base and then customize it as necessary.

The project is already configured to use autoimports for React Hooks, so there is no
need to import default React Hooks inside your components.

## Technologies

As mentioned before, the idea is to use something simple to start a project.

- React: v18.0.0;
- Vite: 2.9.5;
- TailwindCSS: 3.0.24;
- Typescript: 4.6.3;
- Vitest: 0.10.0;
